Depending on which phoneset is used, there can be anywhere from 30-50+ phones, not counting inflection, accent and emotional variations. Recording all phonemes, or in our case diphone pairs, should make it possible (in theory, at least) to generate every word if we can manage to go effectively from text to phonemes and do good audio stitching. This approach can work quite well for English speech synthesis, but I think the approach is more difficult for other languages, especially ones with non Romance/Latin origins.\n",

The primary reason I chose a pure Python approach, rather than using the (much superior) implementation in [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier) is so that I could serialize the tree once and save it in this repo, not worrying about possible API changes in future versions of sklearn.

Testing the resulting 2 datasets for \"purity\", measured by the entropy of the labels in each half, our goal is to find splits where all the labels are the same in one of the halves. Choosing the candidate split which was the most pure, we recusively apply the same logic in each half until we reach splits with entropy 0, meaning all the labels in this split are the same - sometimes phrased as \"the leaf is pure\". This means that as long as there is valid 1:1 mapping in the feature set (the same set of features don't map to 2 different labels), a deep enough decision tree will be *perfect* on the training set.\n",

        "Some drawbacks to the type of system described above can be seen in this [lecture](http://festvox.org/11752/slides/lecture11.pdf). In general there is a sliding scale between composibility and tractable recording size as even word level recordings would require ~100k recorded words to capture the most common English words - not to mention nouns, slang, words derived other languages (foods, local sayings), and so on. However the longer sequences become the less stitching artifacts exist, and the more you are able to capture \"natural\" sound or avoid unnatural dynamics at the stitch boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding prosody features, emotional inflections, and other text preprocessing can be a huge boost, as well as performing true structured prediction on the phonemes (or even diphones) using something like a conditional random field (CRF), hidden Markov model (HMM), or recurrent neural network, instead of the cheap Markov features I used here. Audio representations for more natural splicing of sound, as well as introducing more special case diphones (or even expanding to triphones) are another way to improve these results. There are a huge number of ways to improve these types of systems, and it is a lot of fun to explore if you don't mind hearing weird robot voices once in a while.\n",
